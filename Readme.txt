Positions are saved to: "<PsuedoregaliaFolder>/pseudoregalia/Binaries/Win64/Mods/PseudoregaliaSavestates/Saves/SavedPositions.txt"
Keybinds saved in "<PsuedoregaliaFolder>/pseudoregalia/Binaries/Win64/Mods/PseudoregaliaSavestates/Scripts/config_keybinds.lua"

When saving a Position, you can set it's behaviour when already in the same area:
F5-F8 - Position IDs 1-4
Ctrl only - Save Position with Area Reload enabled
Ctrl + Shift - Save Position with Area Reload disabled
Alt + Shift - Save Position with Save Reload enabled

Note: In my testing Teleport only has a somewhat higher chance to cause crashes, though it is inconsistent.

Default SavedPositions:
F5 - Princess Fight (Area Reload)
F6 - Tower Climb (Teleport)
F7 - Map Update Keep Key Trial Skip (Teleport)
F8 - Underbelly Key approach (Teleport)
